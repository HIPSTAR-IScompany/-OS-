# Proton.md - SphereOS Synthesizer: Generating Komuro Progression

## Overview

This section explains how to generate the iconic "Komuro progression" (Am-F-G-C) using the SphereOS Synthesizer.

### What is the Komuro Progression?

The Komuro progression is a famous chord progression often used in J-POP music, named after producer Tetsuya Komuro. The progression is structured as follows:

- Am (A minor)
- F (F major)
- G (G major)
- C (C major)

This progression creates a smooth, uplifting melodic flow commonly associated with popular Japanese music.

## Python Code: Generating the Komuro Progression

Below is the Python script for generating a MIDI file with the Komuro progression. This script uses the `midiutil` library:

```python
# (Insert the Python code from above here)
```

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Your Environment**  
   - Install the `midiutil` library using pip:  
     ```bash
     pip install midiutil
     ```

2. **Run the Script**  
   - Copy the script above into a Python file (e.g., `komuro_progression.py`).  
   - Run the script in your Python environment:  
     ```bash
     python komuro_progression.py
     ```

3. **Open the Generated MIDI File**  
   - The script generates a file named `komuro_progression.mid`.  
   - Open this file in your favorite Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) or MIDI player.

## Conceptualizing the Komuro Progression

This script not only demonstrates how to programmatically generate music but also illustrates the connection between programming and music theory. By understanding the progression and its application, AI can better replicate and innovate upon this foundational concept.
